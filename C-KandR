4.3 External Variables
-External variables are defined out side of any function -> available to many functions
-Functions are always external
-?How to define external variables and functions taht are visible only within a single source file
-External variables used for communicating data between functions
-? Why push(pop() - pop()) is wrong?

4.4 Scope Rules
-Declaration of an external variable        vs.         its definition
  +announce the properties of a variable		 +causes storage to be set aside
  +ex: 							 +ex:lines below appear outside of any function
	extern int sp;							int sp;
	extern double var[];						double val[MAXVAL];
-TODO:re-read

4.5 Header Files
-Reason: There is only one copy (for 'definition' and 'declaration') to get right and keep right as the program evolves

?: getch.c should include calc.h ?

4.6 Static Variables
-'static' applies to an external variable or function to limit the scope of theat object to the rest of the source file being compiled
-internal 'static' varibales provide private, permanent storage within a single function
